Adaptive learning of optimaL-transport-based cell alignment and evolution
Single-cell and spatial profiling technologies provide unprecedented insights into complex biological systems; however, their destructive nature prevents repeatedly profiling the same cell over time. Aligning these temporal snapshots is essential for reconstructing the evolution of cell populations and uncovering the mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions.

In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Learning of optimaL-transpOrt-based Cell AlignmenT and Evolution (ALLOCATE). Unlike classical optimal transport methods that require predefined marginals, ALLOCATE adaptively learns the left marginal from the data. By explicitly modeling key characteristics of temporally evolving cellular systems, this adaptive marginal estimation mitigates spurious transport and produces reliable temporal cell-cell alignments.

ALLOCATE enables accurate downstream analyses, including cell-type transitions and linage differentiation across temporal snapshots, cell growth potential inference, and cell subtype identification. Comprehensive benchmarking studies and real-world applications demonstrate ALLOCATE’s superior accuracy, robustness, and ability to uncover dynamic biological insights. We believe that ALLOCATE represents a significant advance in tracking dynamic cell-state transitions and cell fate decisions.
